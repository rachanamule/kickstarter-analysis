# Kickstarting With Excel

## Overview Of Project

### Background:

Louise's play Fever is close to its fundraising goal within short amount of time. She would like to collect information about how different campaigns have been proceeded so for in terms of their launch date and their funding goals.

Using Kickstarter dataset we will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch date and funding goals. 

This is the written report based on analysis and visualization created using the kickstarter dataset.

### Purpose:

Purpose of this project to deliver, 

1. Outcome Based on Launch Date Chart

2. Outcome Based on Goal Chart

3. A Written Analysis of the result

## Analysis And Challanges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date chart shows the graphical representation of data about campaigns successful, failed and calceled based on months.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There could be possibility of missing values while specifing the goal range in countifs so need to be careful while entering the values and also need to double check the formula.

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. Highest amount of money raised by the successful campaign launched in May where as the lowest amount of money raised by the successful campaign in december.
2. From the result chart of fail and canceled campaign outcomes looks like there is no perticular month for them to fail or cancel.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. The most successful campaing are having the goal limit less than 20000 and between 35000 to 45000.While the goal limit between 20000 to 35000 and above 45000 are not successful.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

We can see there are different currencies in dataset but there should be column for foreign currency exchange rate. Or there should be option to select different currencies rather than using only USD for outcomes based on goals.


What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. We can create the table and chart outcome based on launch date by filtering further with country.
